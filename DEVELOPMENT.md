Week 1:
11/24/2020
Today, we got our project approved and had our first weekly meeting. During this meeting, we planned out our class
structure and implemented a basic skeleton of each of our classes to get us started. We decided that we need classes
for: airport, BFS traversal, graph, and shortest path finder. We also implemented the Makefile. For next meeting, we 
each chose parts of the project to work on, and we will be sharing our progress at our next meeting this Saturday. 
Danielle will work on implementing the Landmark Path algorithm, Sharon will work on Dijkstra's algorithm, Nadine will
work on the BFS Traversal, and Brianna will work on the Graph and Airport classes. We will be creating our own 
branches to push our progress, and merging our work during meetings.

Today, we met to discuss our progress and current goals. Brianna completed the remainder of the Airport class & 
Nadine has made significant progress on the BFS traversal, she is planning on testing it next. Danielle worked on
importing the data & understanding the landmark path algorithm (she will be using the BFS traversal to implement it
once the traversal is completed). Sharon worked on the README & understanding the Dijkstra's algorithm. We also
discussed in our meeting today and decided that for the Dijkstra's algorithm, we will be finding the shortest path
between two airport locations that are passed in to algorithm's function. We have postponed our next meeting to next
Wednesday instead of Tuesday. We plan on completing Airport, Graph, BFS & partial implementations (at least) of both
the algorithms before our mid-project check-in.
