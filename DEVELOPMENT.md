Week 1:
11/24/2020
Today, we got our project approved and had our first weekly meeting. During this meeting, we planned out our class
structure and implemented a basic skeleton of each of our classes to get us started. We decided that we need classes
for: airport, BFS traversal, graph, and shortest path finder. We also implemented the Makefile. For next meeting, we 
each chose parts of the project to work on, and we will be sharing our progress at our next meeting this Saturday. 
Danielle will work on implementing the Landmark Path algorithm, Sharon will work on Dijkstra's algorithm, Nadine will
work on the BFS Traversal, and Brianna will work on the Graph and Airport classes. We will be creating our own 
branches to push our progress, and merging our work during meetings.

11/28/2020
Today, we met to discuss our progress and current goals. Brianna completed the remainder of the Airport class & 
Nadine has made significant progress on the BFS traversal, she is planning on testing it next. Danielle worked on
importing the data & understanding the landmark path algorithm (she will be using the BFS traversal to implement it
once the traversal is completed). Sharon worked on the README & understanding the Dijkstra's algorithm. We also
discussed in our meeting today and decided that for the Dijkstra's algorithm, we will be finding the shortest path
between two airport locations that are passed in to algorithm's function. We have postponed our next meeting to next
Wednesday instead of Tuesday. We plan on completing Airport, Graph, BFS & partial implementations (at least) of both
the algorithms before our mid-project check-in.

Week 2:
12/2/2020
We had our third meeting yesterday & our mid-project check-in today. We decided to slightly change the 
implementation of our graph to be the same as lab_ml instead of changing the Vertex to represent the Airport class 
instead of strings as we first intended. We also decided to add a airports map or dictionary to our ShortestPathFinder 
class to hold the values for latitude and longitude to calculate distances between airports. We may later change this 
dictionary to hold an Airport object as the value rather than a pair with doubles for latitude and longitude, so that we 
can store more info about the data. Brianna will be working on possibly adding this change, as well as now 
implementing the main method and methods for printing the results generated by the algorithms/traversal. Danielle 
completed the implementation of reading the data & initializing the airports dictionary. She also implemented creating 
the graph by inserting vertices for the airports and edges for the routes between airports, as well as setting the edge
weights based on the distance between the airports.

Week 3:
12/8/2020
Thus far, we have completed implementing BFS & are almost done with out Dijkstra algorithm implementation. It 
currently works on sample data sets, but takes a very long time to run on the full data set. We will be using our Dijkstra
algorithm to complete our implementation of the Landmark Path algorithm. We plan on completing both these items 
tomorrow. Afterwards, we will just need to polish up our code and make sure our results are printed & displayed. We 
can also change our program so that the user can input which data files are read. We have also begun to plan out our 
final presentation, and are meeting up tomorrow night to discuss how we will be distributing the parts for our 
presentation. We will likely be filming parts of a script separately and compiling them into a video as our final 
presentation. We hope to finish everything by Thursday night.
