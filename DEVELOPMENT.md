Week 1:
11/24/2020

Today, we got our project approved and had our first weekly meeting. During this meeting, we planned out our class
structure and implemented a basic skeleton of each of our classes to get us started. We decided that we need classes
for: airport, BFS traversal, graph, and shortest path finder. We also implemented the Makefile. For next meeting, we 
each chose parts of the project to work on, and we will be sharing our progress at our next meeting this Saturday. 
Danielle will work on implementing the Landmark Path algorithm, Sharon will work on Dijkstra's algorithm, Nadine will
work on the BFS Traversal, and Brianna will work on the Graph and Airport classes. We will be creating our own 
branches to push our progress, and merging our work during meetings.
